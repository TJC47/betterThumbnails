# Better Level Thumbnails
This is **not** a mod by itself but rather an **addon** to the level thumbnails mod, adding some features, that cdc wouldn't add, because he's either too lazy or ~~too stupid~~ doesn't see any use for it for himself.
This mod ***requires*** Level Thumbnails as a dependency
