# Better Level Thumbnails
This is **not** a mod by itself but rather an **addon** to the level thumbnails mod, adding some features, that cdc wouldn't add, because he's either too lazy or ~~too stupid~~ doesn't see any use for it for himself.
This mod ***requires*** Level Thumbnails as a dependency

# Features
- none yet lmfao

# Credits
Lots and **LOTS** of credits to arcticwoof he improved my silly code and did all to most of the ui stuff lol
